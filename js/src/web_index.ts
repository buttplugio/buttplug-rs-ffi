// Godawful hack for CDN support.
//
// Since users are used to being able to include the library off CDNs, I wanted
// to keep supporting that with the new WASM package. Unfortunately WASM
// requires webpack to chunk loading due to the async nature of WASM loads,
// which means dynamic import() calls. In order to make sure the import always
// includes itself on the correct domain, we have to:
//
// - Get the URL of the CDN we're on (via querying the currently processed
//   script. Hacky as hell.)
// - Override Webpack's special __webpack_public_path__ variable with that path.
// - Have the user call the buttplugInit() method to actually load the WASM
//   blob.
//
// Gross, but it does the job.

declare var __webpack_public_path__: any;

var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName( "script" );
var lastScript = scripts[scripts.length - 1].src;
__webpack_public_path__ = lastScript.substr(0, lastScript.lastIndexOf('/') + 1);
